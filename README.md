      conda env create --file MOHID_Preprocessing_environment.yml
  
**4. Activate the environment:**

    conda activate MOHID_Preprocessing_environment

**5. Install Jupyter Notebook:**

       conda install -c conda-forge notebook

**6. Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

- Once the installation is complete, you can start Jupyter Notebook by running:

        jupyter notebook
